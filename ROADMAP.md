## Phase 1 — Frontend-only quick wins ✅ done

Originally scoped as frontend-only; the cut-line overlay item below ended up needing one small,
isolated backend change (see that item) once "show the cut sequence" became "draw it visibly on
the board," but stayed low-risk and additive — no other item in this phase touches the backend.

- ✅ **Cut-sequence view.** `OptResult.cuts` (the ordered straight-cut list per sheet, built in
  `optimizer/guillotine.py` since M2) already comes back from `/optimize` but is never rendered
  anywhere in the UI or PDF. Highest value-to-effort item on the whole roadmap — it's "build UI
  for data that already exists," not new computation. **Built as `CutList.tsx`**, a per-sheet
  disclosure inside `SheetPreview.tsx` — listed in API order (vertical cuts by ascending offset,
  then horizontal), not re-derived or reordered, since the data has no explicit sequence field
  beyond that.
- ✅ **Cut-line overlay** (added after Phase 1 was first marked done, per explicit request —
  cut-lines needed to be *visible*, not just listed as numbers in a table). **This is the one
  item in Phase 1 that isn't frontend-only**: the same overlay was also requested for the Panel
  Saw PDF drawing, so `optimizer/export/pdf.py` gained a `margin` parameter on
  `render_layout_pdf` (previously absent — `CutInstruction.offset` already bakes in
  `margin.left`/`.top`, but `.length` is only a span, so the line's start along the other axis
  has nowhere else to come from) and a `_draw_cut_lines` helper that draws each cut as a red
  dashed line using the exact same `scale`/`origin_x`/`origin_y` transform already used for
  parts. `margin` defaults to zero so pre-existing callers/tests didn't need updating.
  Frontend-side, `SheetPreview.tsx` renders the same lines as SVG `<line>` elements computed by
  a `cutLineBounds()` helper that mirrors the backend's `_cut_line_bounds()` exactly (same gap,
  same fix). `CutList.tsx` became a **controlled** component (`open`/`onToggle` props instead of
  a plain uncontrolled `<details>`) so the SVG overlay's visibility ties to the same disclosure
  toggle — expanding the cut list also draws the lines on the board preview, collapsing it hides
  them again, avoiding a second separate toggle. Nanxing PDFs/previews are naturally unaffected:
  `optimizer/nanxing.py` never populates `OptResult.cuts` (confirmed by reading it directly), so
  the overlay code paths simply have nothing to draw there.
  Covered by `backend/tests/test_pdf.py` (+4 tests: `_cut_line_bounds()` unit tests for both
  orientations, an integration test running a real saw job's cuts through `render_layout_pdf`
  end to end, and a no-margin-argument backward-compatibility test) — verified the two unit
  tests have teeth by temporarily reverting `_cut_line_bounds()` to ignore margin, reran, both
  failed as expected, restored. Full suite: 109→113 passing.
  Verified in a real headless browser (`panel_saw_machine_data.csv`, 21 sheets): cut lines are
  hidden by default, expanding Sheet 1's cut list (17 cuts) renders exactly 17 `<line>` elements
  matching the table row count 1:1, collapsing hides them again, zero console errors. Also
  visually confirmed on the actual rendered PDF (rasterized via `pdftoppm` and inspected) — the
  red dashed lines run exactly along the real guillotine cut boundaries between the colored
  panels, not offset or crossing through them.
  **Follow-on, same phase (`Issues/issues_003.md`):** the drawn overlay itself confused panel-saw
  operators on some real layouts (dense sheets with many small cuts made the dashed grid hard to
  read against the part boundaries), so it needed to be a toggle rather than always-on. Added
  **"Show cut lines"** as a checkbox in the Saw section of `ParamsPanel.tsx` (default flipped to
  **off** shortly after, see below), wired through `OptRequest.showCutLines`. Suppresses only the
  drawn overlay, not the underlying data: the numbered cut list and the PDF's "Cut Length" stats
  stay available either way — only the SVG `<line>`/PDF dashed-line rendering is gated. Backend:
  `render_layout_pdf` gained a `show_cut_lines` parameter that swaps in an empty cuts list for
  the board drawing only when off; `api.py`'s `/export/pdf` reads `showCutLines` from the request
  body. Frontend: `SheetPreview.tsx`'s line rendering is now gated on `showCutLines && expanded`
  (both the global setting and the per-sheet disclosure), while the `CutList` table's own
  open/close state stays independent of the global setting.
  Covered by 2 new backend tests (115 total): one asserts the PDF content stream's dash-pattern
  operator (`[3 2] 0 d`, `_draw_cut_lines`'s literal ReportLab output) is present when the
  setting is on and absent when off — a precise signal that lines were actually drawn, not just
  that the page didn't crash — and one confirms the "Sheet Cut Length" stat text still appears
  even with the setting off. Verified the dash-pattern test has teeth: temporarily removed the
  gate, reran, it failed as expected, restored. Verified end-to-end in a real headless browser:
  checkbox defaults to checked, unchecking it and rerunning produces a job with zero `.cut-line`
  elements even with the sheet's cut list expanded, and the downloaded PDF with the setting off
  was rasterized and visually confirmed to have a clean board diagram (no dashed overlay) while
  the sidebar's Cutting List and Cut Length stats are still present. `tsc -b`/lint/build clean.
  **Default flipped to off, same phase:** asked directly to make "Show cut lines" default to
  false. Changed in three places for consistency: `App.tsx`'s initial `useState`, `api.py`'s
  fallback when the request omits the field, and `render_layout_pdf`'s own parameter default in
  `optimizer/export/pdf.py` — all three previously defaulted `True`, now all default `False`, so
  no layer silently disagrees with the others. One existing test relied on the old implicit
  default to exercise the overlay-drawing path; updated to pass `show_cut_lines=True` explicitly
  so it still tests what it's named for. Added a new test asserting the no-argument call is
  byte-for-byte identical to an explicit `show_cut_lines=False` call — verified with teeth
  (reverted the default, reran, failed as expected, restored). Suite: 115→116. Verified in a real
  headless browser: checkbox now loads unchecked, a freshly run job's cut list expands with zero
  `.cut-line` elements drawn, and PDF download still works normally at the new default.
- ✅ **Loading/progress state** for the `/optimize` call on large jobs (the reported 656-part job
  is a good real test case). **Built**: a CSS spinner on the "Run optimize" button plus a
  "Nesting N parts…" status line while the request is in flight; the "Back" button is now also
  disabled during the request (wasn't before).
- ✅ **Table sort/filter/search** on the unplaced-parts table and the Stock Board Library table —
  both are plain unsorted tables today, fine at small scale, not at real job sizes. **Built** as
  a shared `useTableControls` hook (search text + click-to-sort, both tables reuse it — two real
  consumers, not a hypothetical one) and a shared `SortableTh` component for the clickable
  sortable header cells.

Verified in a real headless browser against the real 656-part reported job: sort-by-material
correctly reorders a Stock Board Library with two added boards, search correctly filters to
matching rows, the spinner appears during the optimize request, and a sheet's cut list expands
to show real numbered rows (6–11 depending on the sheet). Zero console errors. `tsc -b`/lint/
build all clean. The cut-line overlay (added after the rest of this phase) was separately
verified against `panel_saw_machine_data.csv` — see that item for the specifics.

## Phase 2 — Data visualization ✅ done

Still frontend-only — every number these need is already in the `/optimize` response — but more
design work than Phase 1, hence its own phase. No new charting dependency was added — the
project already renders `SheetPreview.tsx` with raw SVG, so all three items here follow that same
lightweight-custom-SVG pattern instead of pulling in a chart library for what turned out to be
simple bar charts.

- ✅ **Per-sheet utilization chart**, so one bad sheet doesn't hide among a wall of individual SVG
  previews. **Built as `UtilizationChart.tsx`**: one bar per *physical* sheet, in job order (not
  deduplicated the way the PDF's "Occurrences" view is — collapsing duplicates would hide exactly
  the "which specific sheet is bad" signal this chart exists for). Bars are threshold-colored
  (`--success` ≥70%, `--accent` 40–70%, `--warning` <40%) and horizontally scrollable for jobs
  with many sheets (the reported job has 67 after the M10/M11 fixes).
- ✅ **Material/waste breakdown chart** — sheets and waste % per material, for jobs spanning
  multiple materials (the reported job has 5). **Built as `MaterialBreakdown.tsx`**: groups
  sheets by material, computes each material's sheet count and average waste % (`100 -` average
  utilization), and renders one horizontal bar-in-row per material, worst-waste-first — the
  material most worth a shop owner's attention leads. Skips rendering entirely for single-material
  jobs (would just repeat the Summary's "Avg. utilization" stat card).
- ✅ **Waste-strategy side-by-side comparison** — orchestrates two `/optimize` calls client-side
  (`"balanced"` vs `"edge"`) and shows results together; no new endpoint needed. **Built as
  `WasteStrategyComparison.tsx`**: a button offering to compare against whichever strategy isn't
  currently active, re-running `/optimize` with the *exact* current request except
  `wasteStrategy` flipped (same parts/stock/margins/target — an apples-to-apples comparison, not
  a fresh job), then showing Sheets/Avg. utilization/Unplaced parts side by side for both. Lazy —
  the second `/optimize` call only fires on click, not on every results view.

Verified in a real headless browser against two real jobs: the 656-part multi-material reported
job (`26Y117T1F1B1(BEDROOM 3-4)`, 67 sheets after M10/M11) — utilization chart bar count matches
the Summary's "Sheets" stat exactly (67), material breakdown shows all 5 real materials sorted by
waste descending, and the strategy comparison populates both columns with real numbers after
clicking; and `panel_saw_machine_data.csv` (21 sheets, 2 materials) — confirmed the three
utilization color tiers all render distinctly. Also visually confirmed in dark mode (Playwright
`colorScheme: "dark"`) — every color in the new components comes from the existing CSS custom
properties, so no separate dark-mode work was needed, just verification that it actually held.
Zero console errors either job. `tsc -b`/lint/build all clean.

## Phase 3 — Presets & cost tracking

First phase touching the backend — but reuses the CRUD pattern M9 already built for stock
boards (SQLite table + `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` endpoints), not new architecture.

- **Named parameter presets** — margin/kerf/waste-strategy bundles (e.g. "Standard Panel Saw
  run"), saved and reused the same way stock boards are today.
- **Cost-per-board field** on stock boards, plus a $-cost-of-waste figure shown alongside the
  utilization %. Weight this one heaviest in the phase — it turns an abstract percentage into a
  number a shop owner feels directly, and is the strongest "here's what this app is worth"
  argument if it's ever sold or licensed.

## Phase 4 — Job history

Follows Phase 3 rather than preceding it, since a saved job record is more useful once it can
also capture which preset and cost basis were used. Needs a real new table — every optimize run
is currently discarded the moment the results screen is left — plus a browsing/comparison UI.

## Phase 5 — M8 offcut reuse

The largest remaining item, and the one that makes the Phase 2/3 waste numbers actionable
rather than just informative: persist real offcuts as usable stock, feed them back into the
optimizer as available input for future jobs, and give operators a "waste bank" to browse.
Naturally sits on top of Phase 4's data model rather than before it.

## Cross-cutting — not a phase

- **Frontend test suite.** Start alongside Phase 1, not bolted on at the end, so Phases 2–5 get
  regression coverage as they land instead of everything being manually browser-verified the
  way every frontend change has been so far (`frontend/` currently has no automated tests —
  type-check, build, lint, and manual Playwright passes are the only verification).

---

## On reordering

This sequencing optimizes for "cheapest to build next," not necessarily "matters most to the
business." If cost tracking (Phase 3) or offcut reuse (Phase 5) is actually the priority, either
can be pulled forward — Phase 3's preset half and Phase 5 don't depend on Phases 1–2 completing
first, only on the backend patterns M9 already established.

Also unrelated to this roadmap but still open per `CLAUDE.md`'s own "Remaining work" list: a
physical machine dry-run to confirm M6/M10/M11's output on real material, and the deferred parts
of M9 (login/auth, tenant/company modeling, per-machine "available optimizations" config,
CSV-schema-template renaming). Those aren't UI/UX or data-viz work, so they're tracked in
`CLAUDE.md` rather than duplicated here.
