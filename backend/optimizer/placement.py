# Not part of either packing engine (saw_packing.py / nanxing_packing.py stay deliberately
# un-shared per update_003.md — see CLAUDE.md's M2 row) — this is a pure post-placement
# coordinate transform, so sharing it doesn't touch the "two machines = two different
# optimizers" principle: it never influences which parts get placed where relative to each
# other, only where the whole already-decided layout sits on the board.
#
# Prompted by a real physical dry-run (Issues/issues_005.md): a demo job cut 6-7mm short on one
# axis, with nesting-pro's default placement sitting in a different corner of the table than the
# machine's own inbuilt optimizer's placement for a comparable job. To test whether table
# position (vacuum-zone coverage, axis calibration, fence distance) affects cut accuracy, the
# *exact* layout needs to be reproducible in a different board corner — this lets the operator
# choose one without changing anything about how parts get nested.

    "bottom-left" (the packer's native fill origin — see saw_packing.py's/nanxing_packing.py's
    free_rects seed) is a no-op. The other three corners are area- and shape-preserving
    reflections: a layout that's guillotine-decomposable, has no overlaps, and stays within
    margin bounds before mirroring stays exactly so afterward, since reflection is rigid.

    Axis note: PlacedPart.x/w run along the packer's local x axis (board.width-derived);
    PlacedPart.y/h run along local y (board.length-derived) — see saw_packing.py's
    place_parts_on_board. So a "right" corner (further along the board's *length*) mirrors y/h;
    a "top" corner (further along the board's *width*) mirrors x/w — matching how those words
    read in the machine's own on-screen layout (X horizontal/length, Y vertical/width, per M11).
