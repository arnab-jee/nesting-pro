# Appendix A.2's Lineament.ProOffsetX/Y=3 is not just a cosmetic attribute: verified against
# golden data that every Workpiece.Lineament polygon spans (CutLength + 2*offset) x
# (CutWidth + 2*offset), not the raw cut rectangle — Lineament is the router's tool-path
# envelope around the cut line, not the cut line itself. Oddments' Lineament has no such
# offset (confirmed 0/60 samples carry ProOffset attrs) and spans the raw free rectangle.

# Fields deliberately NOT reproduced here, because their derivation isn't specified by
# instructions.md/Appendix A and guessing risks a file the machine's parser mis-trusts:
#   - Workpiece.CutInfos ToolPoint — always emitted as "0" (Appendix A.5's own stated
#     default). No rule for which of the 4 lead-in points is actually best was found in the
#     golden data; a machine dry-run is needed before trusting a non-default choice.
#   - Workpiece.IsIntersectsWith — observed on <2% of real workpieces with no documented
#     trigger condition.
#   - Workpiece.Info1 / Info2 — present on every real workpiece but their relationship to
#     any other field (Length/Width/CutLength/CutWidth) doesn't hold consistently across
#     samples; not worth fabricating.
