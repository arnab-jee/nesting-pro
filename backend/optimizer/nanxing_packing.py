    `waste_strategy` picks which axis that cut runs along:
    - "balanced" (default): cut along whichever axis leaves the *shorter* leftover strip,

      can fragment leftover space into many small pieces scattered across the sheet.

      height and the "top" child is only ever as wide as the part just placed. Leftover
      space then keeps accumulating into one shrinking strip per free region instead of
      being sliced into a new top-strip on every placement — consolidating wastage toward
