# Issues/issues_002.md: a real Nanxing machine load showed every job crammed into a region no
# bigger than the board's *width*, with the rest of the board's real *length* left empty. Root
# cause: optimizer/export/xml.py wrote PlacedPart.x (the packer's board.width-axis coordinate,
# max ~1205mm on a 2440x1220 board) straight into the XML's X attribute, which the machine
# reads as the board's *length* axis (expects up to ~2430mm) — and PlacedPart.y (board.length-
# axis, max ~2430mm) into Y, which the machine reads as *width* (expects up to ~1205mm). The
# golden-file round-trip test never caught this because its importer (fcc_golden.py) made the
# exact same (backwards) assumption on the way in, so import+export cancelled out — round-trip
# fidelity was preserved even though the axis labeling was wrong for real packer-sourced data.
# These tests exercise the real packer -> exporter path directly, which the round-trip test
# never did.
